In this project, I will predicted the Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) by differentiate the Benign tumors and Malignant tumors on the patient diagnoses based on the measurements of nuclear shape with Machine Learning. The Model I used on this Machine Learning are **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **KNeighbours**, and **SVM** towards our variable target **diagnose**

This project caontains : **Business Understanding**, **Data Understanding**, **Data Cleaning**, **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Preprocessing** and **Modeling**
